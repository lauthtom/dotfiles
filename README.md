# Dotfiles for dwm, xterm and vim
Feel free to use my dotfiles and play with them :)

## Installing DWM
1. Install your Dependencies for your System (just google them). 
2. Create a **~/.config/suckless** folder if not exists
3. Then cd in your **/suckless** folder and clone following repos:
`git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm` and `git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu`
4. Do a `sudo make clean install` in each of the cloned folder
5. Finally, move this **.xinitrc** in your home directory
6. Reboot your system and type `startx`
