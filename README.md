## Dotfiles for dwm, xterm and vim
Feel free to use my dotfiles and play with them :)

### Installing DWM
Install your Dependencies for your System, just google them. Then clone the 
following repos in your ~/.config/suckless folder <br />
`git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm` and <br /> 
`git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu` <br />
